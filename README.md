# Daniel Mercede

Systems architect and technology executive building at the intersection of logic, responsibility, and human dynamics.

This repository hosts the source for **danielmercede.com**, a long-form biographical and contextual site intended to provide narrative depth and professional grounding beyond résumé or profile summaries.

## Purpose

This site exists to offer **context**, not promotion.

It documents the experiences, environments, and perspectives that inform the systems I build today — with an emphasis on operational realism, governance, and long-term system integrity.

This is not a portfolio, product site, or marketing surface.
